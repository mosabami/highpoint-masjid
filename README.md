# Highpoint Masjid Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It hosts the code used to build the Highpoint Masjid in Highpoint, West Seattle. This website will be used as a templated to build other free mosque websites in the future. It is loosely based on [Mosque Screen's](https://github.com/Mosque-Screens) [Mosque website](https://github.com/Mosque-Screens/mosque.website) but converted to react and having some lifecycle improvments added to make it easy for mosques to host their free website on GitHub Pages.

Some of those improvements include the following:
1. The addition of GitHub actions pipeline to build and deploy the website to GitHub pages. For more information on that check out [this blog](https://dev.to/achukka/deploy-react-app-using-github-actions-157d) for more information
1. Conversion of the Next.js app to React
1. Movement of all data to the data files so user only needs up update the data files for their needs
1. Addition of a proper nav bar
1. Addition of an events page
1. Update data file to support new paradigm
